#HeadHunter vacancies parser
ðŸ¤–ðŸ”¨ Telegram bot that parses HH.ru vacancies in accordance with given parameters and returns .xlsx file with some statistics on salary.

This bot works based on Telegram and HH.ru APIs.

Bot asks user to enter a bunch of parameters to start searching (eg. vacancy name, specializations, region, etc.). It connects with HH.ru API then and gathers necessary information into one excel file. It also counts some statistics on salary and includes into the same file.

The idea of the project was born when I was working as HR and had to do market analysis. I wanted to build some process that would automate gathering information for further analysis. Now my skills helped me in achieving this goal :)
